# Twitter/X Blog Guidelines for Content Creators

- Aim for sharp, concise messaging. Attention spans are short.
- Hook: The first tweet must grab attention in 280 characters or less.
- Use line breaks to create "white space" for skimmability.
- Threads: Use numbered tweets or emojis to show continuity.
- Avoid jargon unless your audience expects it.
- Always provide a CTA (call to action) at the end: ask a question, drop a link, or invite engagement.
- Format examples:
  - 🚀 “Here’s how I built a side hustle that pays my rent 👇”
  - “Stop writing boring hooks. Try this instead 🧵”
